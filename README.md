# Accessibility Demo: ADA/WCAG Compliance Examples
This project demonstrates various web accessibility principles outlined in the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). It provides examples of both accessible and inaccessible implementations across different types of web content, such as media, text, navigation, and more. The goal is to educate developers, designers, and content creators about the importance of accessibility and how to implement it effectively.

Additionally, this README includes instructions for embedding LinkedIn feeds into your Glitch-hosted site, should you wish to display your LinkedIn posts dynamically.

6. Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide practical examples of accessibility best practices and common pitfalls. By comparing accessible and inaccessible implementations, this project highlights the impact of design choices on user experience, particularly for individuals with disabilities.

# Key focus areas include:

1, Media : Videos with captions vs. videos without captions.
2. Text : Proper contrast ratios vs. poor contrast.
3. Navigation : Keyboard-friendly navigation vs. inaccessible navigation.
4. Forms : Accessible form inputs vs. inaccessible forms.
5. Other WCAG Principles : Semantic HTML, ARIA roles, alt text for images, etc.
6. These examples align with WCAG 2.1 success criteria and ADA compliance requirements, ensuring that your website is usable by as many people as possible, regardless of ability.

# Accessible vs. Inaccessible Examples

* Media:

Accessible Video : Includes captions and playback controls for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Inaccessible Video : Lacks captions and demonstrates poor accessibility practices.

* Text:

Accessible Text : Uses proper contrast ratios and readable fonts.

Inaccessible Text : Poor contrast ratios or unreadable fonts that make content difficult to read.

* Navigation:

Accessible Navigation : Supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.

Inaccessible Navigation : Relies solely on mouse interaction, excluding users who cannot use a mouse.
Forms

Accessible Form : Includes proper labels, error messages, and ARIA attributes.

Inaccessible Form : Missing labels or unclear instructions, making it difficult for users to complete.

* Other Examples:

Images : Demonstrates proper use of alt text for screen readers vs. missing or irrelevant alt text.

ARIA Roles : Shows how to use ARIA roles effectively vs. misuse or overuse of ARIA.

By comparing these examples, you can see the importance of designing with accessibility in mind.
