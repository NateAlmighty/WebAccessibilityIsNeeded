            As someone who is legally blind without my glasses and used to rely
            on screen readers to navigate the digital world, I know firsthand
            how critical accessibility is. The web should be a place where
            everyone—regardless of ability—can participate fully. Yet, thousands
            of businesses face lawsuits every year for failing to meet
            accessibility standards. In 2022 alone, over
            <strong>3,200 digital accessibility lawsuits</strong> were filed in
            the U.S., a number that continues to rise.

            I’m not just an advocate—I’m a developer who makes websites
            accessible. I specialize in creating inclusive, functional, and
            compliant digital experiences for the disabled community. Whether
            it’s ensuring screen reader compatibility, optimizing for keyboard
            navigation, or designing with colorblind users in mind, I provide
            tailored solutions that meet both legal requirements and user needs.
          </p>

            If you’re ready to make your website accessible and avoid costly
            lawsuits, let’s work together. Accessibility isn’t just the right
            thing to do—it’s a necessity. And I’m here to help you get it done.
